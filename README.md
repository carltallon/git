# Carl Tallon Git Commands
All the git commands you'd ever need &amp; their explanation

# git checkout = switch branches
therefore this creates branch and switches to it
'''console 
git checkout -b branchname
'''

# git merge targetbranchname
combines two branches 
'''console 
git merge targetbranchname
'''
